Instructions
---------------------------------------------------------

Parts needed:

- 3d prints of the case and bottom
- Pro Micro controller. This build used a [Sparkfun Qwiic Pro Micro USB
  C](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15795)
- 59 MX Switches and 2 stabilisers. This build used Gateron Keychron G Pro
  Yellow switches.
- 59 keycaps of which one 2 width keycap. In the build above existing keycaps
  were painted and labelled.
- 4 M2 screw inserts and 4 M2x8mm screws

### Printing

The 3D print files are in the `stl/` directory. Both can be printed without
supports. The case should be printed upside down. The bottom bottom side down.
Supports are not needed. After printing two vertical supports in the slot that
holds the controller need to be removed (these are needed to be able to print
without supports). This can be done using an exacto knive and some prying. The
files are designed to fit a Prusa MK3s.
